# auto-spacer

## Introduction
A little handy online tool for auto spacing code, partially based on the community [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

For example, it automatically adds or removes spaces around operators, punctuations, and parentheses/brackets.

It targets Ruby but would largely work for programming languages with similar set of operators.
